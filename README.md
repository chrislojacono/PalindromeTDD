# PalindromeTDD

This was another exercise to practice Test Driven Development

## Instructions
The word or whole phrase which has the same sequence of letters in
both directions is called a palindrome. Here are few examples:

> Stats
Amore, Roma
No 'x' in Nixon
Was it a cat I saw?

As you can see, case of the letters is ignored. Spaces and punctuations are ignored too.

Your goal in this programming exercise is to write a method that determines whether a phrase represents a palindrome or not.
